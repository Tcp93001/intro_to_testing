This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objective

This repo contains a small app generated with create-react-app, and using Jest and Enzyme to develop a pair of simple tests that check
for a small string on a `p` element when the component is rendered.
<br />

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
